## Project Overview

This project implements a secure authentication system using JWT and file-based user data storage. It showcases the integration of a React frontend with a Node.js/Express.js backend to provide user registration, login, and protected route access, all while managing user data in JSON files.

## What I Learned

- Implementing **file-based user data storage** in a Node.js application.
- Creating and managing **JSON files** for persistent data storage.
- Implementing **JWT-based authentication** with file-stored user credentials.
- Securing routes in an **Express.js** backend using middleware and file-based data.
- Managing authentication state in a **React** frontend application.
- Handling token storage and transmission securely between frontend and backend.
- Implementing protected routes in React for file data operations.
- Balancing file I/O operations with application performance.

This project demonstrates the practical application of file handling and web security practices in a real-world scenario, showcasing the integration of file-based data management with JWT for maintaining user sessions and securing API endpoints.
